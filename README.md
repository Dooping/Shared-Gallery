# Shared-Gallery
## Distributed Systems Final Project

A shared picture gallery system that stores the pictures in a few replicas to prevent loss of data when some of them fail.

Servers can be **REST** or **SOAP** and can also act as a proxy to a remote service (Imgur, Flickr, ...).

Clients have a simple **cache** to improve performance.

The Event Dissemination System used was Apache Kafka.
