<h1><a name="objectivo"></a>Goal</h1>

<p>The goal of the project is to create a system that allows users to
access a shared gallery of pictures. A gallery consists of multiple
albums. Each album consists of a set of pictures.<br>
Users access the gallery through a program with a graphical interface (see environment for details).
Using the application the user can:<br>
</p>

<ul>

  <li>List the existing albums</li>
  <li>Create an album</li>
  <li>Delete an album</li>
  <li>Access the pictures in album</li>
  <li>Add pictures to an album</li>
  <li>Remove a picture from an album<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The albums and pictures will be stored at multiple locations
(servers). The application will have to hide the distributed nature of
the contents of the gallery to the user. For example, a given album can
be have its contents scattered across multiple servers, yet must be
presented to the user as a single unified collection of pictures.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<h1><a name="contexto"></a>Components of the system</h1>

<p>The system must contain, at least, two different components<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Content Server</span><br>
Servers store albums (and pictures) in local storage (file system) and
export an interface that allows clients to access its contents
remotely. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Client</span><br>
The client is the application that users use to access the shared
gallery.<br>
<br>
A sample application on how to use the graphical interface is provided;
the students must extend this application to use the information
obtained from remote servers. (more details at the end of this document)<br>
</p>

<br>

<h1><a name="base1"></a>Functionalities<br>
</h1>

<h2>Server discovery [2 points]<span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Clients must find servers without
the need to enter the address of the server in the client.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Suggestion: use multicast (as in lab
2)&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>Base web services [8 points]</h2>

<p>Must implement a system that supports the functions of the
application using Web Services SOAP.<br>
</p>

<h2>Base REST [5 points]<br>
</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Must implement a system that
supports the functions of the application using REST.</span><br>
</p>

<h2>REST+ [7 points] (alternative to REST) - optional<br>
</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The client must be able to use
the content provided by the two types of servers, supporting a shared
gallery that is distributed across a mix of Web Services based on SOAP
and REST.</span><br>
</p>

<h2>Update interface on changes in the list of available servers [up to 2 points] - optional<br>
</h2>


<p>The client must implement a mechanism to monitor when a server
becomes unavailable, and notify the GUI to update the displayed
information (using the Gui interface).</p>

<h2>Cache data in the client [up to 2 points] - optional<br>
</h2>

<p>The client method must cache
information in a way that it reduces the need to contact the servers.</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>
</p>


<h1><a name="ambiente"></a>Environment<br>
</h1>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT:</span> The project must be demonstrated in the labs, with servers running in <span style="font-weight: bold;">at least two computers</span>, either using existing hardware or student's hardware.</p>
<p>We provide Java clases that implement the user interface of the program. <a href="sd1516-tp1.zip">The code is available here</a>. <br>
</p>
<p>The code uses JavaFX 8u40. JavaFX is included in Java 8 JRE and JDK  distributions, but it <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">requires version 1.8.0_40 or more recent</span>. For <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">compiling in Eclipse you must additionally</span>
set the project's Properties &gt; Java Compiler &gt; Error/Warnings
&gt; Deprecated and Restricted API &gt; Forbidden reference (access
rules) to Warning. <br>
</p>
<p>The code includes classes for the GUI (package sd.tp1.gui) and an
application example that uses the GUI to display picture in the file
system (package sd.tp1.example). <br>
</p>
<p>For implementing project 1, you can use the following classes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>sd.tp1.SharedGallery : main class for starting the shared
gallery client (no need to change, unless you want to add parameters to
your application)</li>
  <li>sd.tp1.SharedGalleryContentProvider : this class defines the
methods that must be implemented for providing the application
functionality. In particular, the following methods are invoked by the
interface for executing a user operation:</li>
  <li>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /**</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* Returns the list of albums in the system.</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* On error this method should return null.</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*/</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public List&lt;Album&gt; getListOfAlbums()</pre>
    <pre><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /**</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* Returns the list of pictures for the given album. </pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* On error this method should return null.</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*/</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public List&lt;Picture&gt; getListOfPictures(Album album)</pre>
    <pre><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /**</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* Returns the contents of picture in album.</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* On error this method should return null.</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*/</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public byte[] getPictureData(Album album, Picture picture)</pre>
    <pre><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /**</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* Create a new album.</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* On error this method should return null.</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*/</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public Album createAlbum(String name) </pre>
    <pre><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /**</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* Delete an existing album.</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*/</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public void deleteAlbum(Album album)</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /**</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* Add a new picture to an album.</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* On error this method should return null.</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*/</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public Picture uploadPicture(Album album, String name, byte[] data) </pre>
    <pre><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /**</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* Delete a picture from an album.</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;* On error this method should return false.</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*/</pre>
    <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public boolean deletePicture(Album album, Picture picture)</pre>
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="report"></a>Written Report:<br></h1>

<p>A written report <b>must</b> be delivered by each group describing their work and implementation. The report should have <b>at most 4 pages</b> <i>(Server APIs should be delivered as an appendix that goes beyond the 4 page limit)</i>, and be delivered in paper at <it>Secretaria</it> in the Informatics Department. The organization of the report is free, and the students should write their report following a structure that makes its contents clear and easy to follow.</p>
	
<p>The report <b>must</b> cover the following topics.</p>
<ul>
  <li> General description of the work performed by the students, clearly identifying which aspects were completed and fully implemented.</li>
  <li> Limitations of the delivered code.</li>
  <li> Interfaces of the servers (both SOAP and REST when applicable).
  <li> Clear explanation of the mechanisms (i.e, protocols) employed for:
  <ul>
	<li>Discovery of servers.</li>
	<li>Detection of server failure.</li>
	<li>Handling of faults (both of individual servers or errors during the execution of requests)</li>
  </ul>
  <li> Discussion of the implementation decisions taken by the students, when applicable, discussing these decisions in light of possible alternatives.</li>
</ul>

<p>The report can also cover aspects related with difficulties felt by the students during the execution of the project or other aspects that the students consider relevant.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<h1><a name="delivery"></a>Delivery Rules:<br></h1>
<p>The project delivery date is 7 of April of 2016. Each group has 2 slip days to spend between the two projects of the course (meaning that at delivery of projects can happen with a delay without any penalty, as long as the sum of the delay across both projects is not above 2 days).</p>
<p>The report delivery date is 12 of April of 2016. Slip days <b>cannot</b> be used for the delivery of the report. The report should be delivered physically at <it>Secretaria</it> in the Informatics Department, stapled and with <b>no</b> cover page. The limit of pages is 4, excluding appendix, that <b>must only contain</b> Server APIs.</p>
